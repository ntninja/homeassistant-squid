# Changelog

## 1.0.9
- **Improved**: Switched to Pip-installed Certbot to ensure the add-on runs the absolute latest version available.

## 1.0.8
- **Fix**: Disabled Certbot's random sleep on renewal, which was causing the add-on to hang and be killed by the Home Assistant watchdog.

## 1.0.7
- **Fix**: Removed blocking renewal check at startup to prevent add-on hangs.
- **Improved**: Background renewal monitor now uses verbose logging for better debugging.

## 1.0.6
- **Fix**: Resolved permission issue where Squid could not read Let's Encrypt certificates.
- **Improved**: Enhanced logging for certificate renewals; errors are no longer suppressed.

## 1.0.5
- **Fix**: Resolved issue where expired certificates were not refreshed at startup.
- **Fix**: Reordered renewal monitor loop to perform an immediate check upon startup.

## 1.0.4
- **Feature**: Added background monitor for automated Let's Encrypt renewal with zero-downtime configuration reloads.
- **Improved**: Added multi-architecture support for amd64, aarch64, armhf, and armv7.
- **Security**: Implemented dynamic port security; port 80 is now restricted to only when HTTP proxying or Let's Encrypt is enabled.

## 1.0.3
- **Schema**: Adjusted configuration schema order for better logical grouping of network settings.

## 1.0.2
- **Update**: Reorganized configuration options for better readability.

## 1.0.1
- **Fix**: Resolved UI localization issues for Caching Configuration by flattening nested keys (e.g. `caching.enabled` -> `cache_enabled`). NOTE: You may need to re-enter your caching settings.
- **Improved**: Documentation explicitly states caching is HTTP-only.

    - TLS Stealth Mode for avoiding bot detection.
